    .. warning::
        `torch.associative_scan` is a prototype feature in PyTorch. It currently

        https://pytorch.org/blog/pytorch-feature-classification-changes/#prototype

    This operator requires runtime code generation and so requires support for
    ``torch.compile``. Further, only CUDA device codegen is supported at the moment.

    Args:
        combine_fn (Callable): A binary callable with type ``(Tensor, Tensor) -> Tensor``,
            or if input is a pytree ``(pytree, pytree) -> pytree``.
            This function must be pure, i.e., no lifted arguments are supported at the moment,
            satisfy the associative property and have no side-effects.
        xs (torch.Tensor): The input tensor, or nested pytree of tensors.
            All inputs are expected to have the same shape.
        dim (int): the dimension to scan over
        reverse (bool): A boolean stating if the scan should be reversed with respect to ``dim``, default ``False``.
        combine_mode (str): A string indicating whether the ``combine_fn`` is ``pointwise`` or ``generic``, default ``pointwise``.
            If ``combine_mode=pointwise``, ``combine_fn`` must be pure, may only contain pointwise operations
            and ``xs`` must be CUDA tensors.
            In all other cases ``combine_mode=generic`` should be used.
            Note: ``combine_mode=pointwise`` is more efficient than ``combine_mode=generic``.

                return x * y

            The ``joint_graph`` g(.,.), used in the backward function, is the gradient of the function f(.,.).
            It computes the gradients for x and y of f. For example for the function f above
            def g(x: torch.Tensor, y: torch.Tensor):
                return y, x
            In other words, the first output of g represents df(x,y)/dx, while the second one represents df(x,y)/dy.
            This will be exploited in the algorithm below.

            The inputs to ``associative_scan`` in the forward path are x_1, x_2, ..., x_T
            The outputs of ``associative_scan`` in the forward path are y_1, y_2, ..., y_T, where
            y_1 = x_1
            y_2 = f(y_1, x_2)
            ...
            y_T = f(y_{T-1}, x_T)

            The gradients of y_T with respect to the vector x are computed as:
            dy_T / dx = dy_T/dx_1 + dy_T/dx_2 + ... + dy_T/dx_T

            A few examples:
            dy_T/dx_T = df(y_{T-1}, x_T)/dx_T -> second output of g(y_{T-1}, x_T)

            dy_T/dx_{T-1} = df(y_{T-1}, x_T)/dy_{T-1} . df(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})/dx_{T-1}
                          -> first output of g(y_{T-1}, x_T) . second output of g(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})

            dy_T/dx_{T-2} = df(y_{T-1}, x_T)/dy_{T-1}
                            . df(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})/dy_{T-2}
                            . df(y_{T-3}, x_{T-2})/dx_{T-2}
                          ->  first output of g(y_{T-1}, x_T)
                            . first output of g(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})
                            . second output of g(y_{T-3}, x_{T-2})

            A conceptually similar pattern can be observerd for dy_{T-1} / dx
            dy_{T-1}/dx_T = 0

            dy_{T-1}/dx_{T-1} = df(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})/dx_{T-1} -> second output of g(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})

            dy_{T-1}/dx_{T-2} = df(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})/dy_{T-2} . df(y_{T-3}, x_{T-2})/dx_{T-2}
                              -> first output of g(y_{T-2}, x_{T-1})
                              . second output of g(y_{T-3}, x_{T-2})

            If one inspects the pattern carefully, it becomes aparant that there is a product of
            'first outputs', followed by the last term which is a 'second output'.
            This can be represented with a matrix-vector multiplication, where the rows of the matrix contain
            the products of the 'first ouputs' and the vector contains the 'second outputs'.
            Furthermore, the product of 'first outputs' is continuously expanded leftwards with
            additional time steps. Therefore, the products can also be computed utilizing cumprod.
            The final gradients can be computed using an elementwise matrix-vector multiplication.

            This implementation is inspired by the "grid form" outlined on
            https://justintchiu.com/blog/pscan_diff/

            As one example, consider:
            x = torch.arange(1, 4)
            o = torch.cumprod(x)

            The gradients of `o` with respect to `x` can be computed as follows:
            Step 1.: Compute the gradients at every scan element with respect to h and x
            grads_h = [1, 2, 3, 4]
            grads_x = [1, 1, 2, 6]
            Step 2.: Compute the gradient matrix
            h_mat = [[do_0/dh_0, do_1/dh_0, do_2/dh_0, do_3/dh_0],
                     [do_1/dh_1, do_1/dh_1, do_2/dh_1, do_3/dh_1],
                     [do_0/dh_2, do_1/dh_2, do_2/dh_2, do_3/dh_2],
                     [do_0/dh_3, do_1/dh_3, do_2/dh_3, do_3/dh_3]]
            which results in
            h_mat = [[1, 2, 6, 24],
                     [0, 1, 3, 12],
                     [0, 0, 1,  4],
                     [0, 0, 0,  1]]
            Note: This involves the cumprod
            Step 3.: scale the matrix with the upstream gradients, e.g., dL_i/do_i
            h_mat * dL_i/do_i
            Step 4.: Reduce the matrix with sum along the columns to get the total contributions for x_i
            sum_mat = [33, 16, 5, 1]
            Step 5.: Scale with the grads_x, e.g., do_i/dx_i, to obtain the final gradients
            grads = [33, 16, 5, 1] * [1, 1, 2, 6]
            grads = [33, 16, 10, 6]
